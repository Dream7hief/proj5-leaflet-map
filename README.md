This is a Leaflet map using MapQuest API   

Author: Logan Poole  
Contact: lpoole3@uoregon.edu  

Application:  
The application centers at Eugene, OR and displaces local Vape Stores while also displaying user's locaton per mouse 'click'.  

Note: I'd like to add location tracking as well as distance calculations to find the closest store relative to the user.  

Running the Application
git clone https://github.com/Dream7hief/proj5-leaflet-map InstallDirecory  
cd InstallDirectory  
bash ./configure  
make run  
site can be reached at: localhost:5000
